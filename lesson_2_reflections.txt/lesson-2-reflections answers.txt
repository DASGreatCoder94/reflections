What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer: Then a .git folder is revealed. And, the reason why this needs to be done is to allow repos to be added. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area prepares files to be added to the working directory from the repository. Once a file is in the working directory, then they can be "commited" on git.
